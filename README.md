IRIS: Image Recognition Integrated Signalling - Colour Detection and Dictation for the Visually Impaired 

We utilize state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence to extract & identify subjects & features from live video footage, for active verbal communication
of colour information directly in front of the user.

Detecting objects with a Convolutional Neural Network, we then utilize Support Vector Machines to classify different text-colour pairs under particular HSV value thresholds.
